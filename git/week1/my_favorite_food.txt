Here's a simple recipe for a delicious bowl of homemade ramen:
Ingredients
	•	2 packs of instant ramen noodles
	•	4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
	•	1 tablespoon soy sauce
	•	1 tablespoon miso paste (optional)
	•	1 tablespoon sesame oil
	•	2 cloves garlic, minced
	•	1 inch piece of ginger, minced
	•	2 eggs
	•	1 cup sliced mushrooms (shiitake or button)
	•	2 green onions, thinly sliced
	•	1 carrot, julienned
	•	Spinach or bok choy leaves, to taste
	•	Toppings: sliced cooked chicken/pork, boiled egg, nori (seaweed), sesame seeds, chili flakes
Instructions
	1.	Prep the Broth
	▪	In a large pot, heat the sesame oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger, and sauté until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.
	▪	Pour in the broth, soy sauce, and miso paste (if using). Whisk until well combined and bring to a gentle simmer.
	2.	Cook the Noodles
	▪	In a separate pot, bring water to a boil and cook the ramen noodles according to the package instructions (usually 3-4 minutes). Drain and set aside.
	3.	Prepare Toppings
	▪	Eggs: Boil eggs for 7 minutes for soft-boiled or longer for your desired doneness. Cool in ice water, peel, and halve.
	▪	Vegetables: In the broth, add mushrooms, green onions, and carrot. Simmer until just tender, about 3-5 minutes. Add spinach or bok choy in the last minute just to wilt.
	4.	Assemble the Ramen
	▪	Divide the cooked noodles into bowls. Ladle the hot broth and vegetables over the noodles.
	▪	Arrange your chosen toppings (chicken, pork, boiled egg, nori, sesame seeds, chili flakes) on top.
	5.	Serve
	▪	Serve immediately, allowing each person to stir their bowl to mix all the flavors.
Enjoy your homemade ramen!
