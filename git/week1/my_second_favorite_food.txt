Here's a simple recipe for classic Mushroom Risotto:
Ingredients
	•	1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
	•	1 quart chicken or vegetable broth, warmed
	•	1 cup fresh mushrooms (like crimini, shiitake, or porcini), sliced
	•	1 small onion, finely chopped
	•	2 cloves garlic, minced
	•	1/2 cup dry white wine (optional)
	•	3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
	•	1 tablespoon olive oil
	•	1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
	•	Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
	•	2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped for garnish
Instructions
	1.	Prepare the Broth: Keep the chicken or vegetable broth warm in a separate saucepan over low heat.
	2.	Sauté Mushrooms: In a large pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until they are soft and browned. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
	3.	Cook Onion and Garlic: In the same pan, add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the chopped onion, and cook until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant.
	4.	Toast the Rice: Add the Arborio rice to the pan, stirring constantly to coat the grains with the oil and butter. Toast the rice until the edges become translucent, about 2-3 minutes.
	5.	Deglaze: Pour in the white wine (if using), stirring constantly until the wine is fully absorbed by the rice.
	6.	Cook the Risotto: Begin adding the warm broth one ladle at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until the liquid is almost fully absorbed before adding more broth. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to al dente, about 18-20 minutes. You may not need to use all the broth.
	7.	Finish the Risotto: Once the rice is cooked, stir in the cooked mushrooms, the remaining butter, and the grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If the risotto is too thick, you can adjust the consistency by adding a little more broth until you reach your desired creaminess.
	8.	Serve: Divide the risotto among plates. Garnish with fresh parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.
Tips
	•	Stirring the risotto constantly is key to releasing the rice's starches, which gives the dish its signature creamy texture.
	•	Feel free to experiment with different types of mushrooms or add other vegetables according to your preference.
	•	Risotto is best served immediately, as it continues to thicken as it sits.
Enjoy your homemade mushroom risotto!
